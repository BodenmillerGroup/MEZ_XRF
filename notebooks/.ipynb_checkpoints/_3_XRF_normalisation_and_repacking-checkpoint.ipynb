    "# 3. XRF normalisation and hdf repacking\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This notebook generates normalised data for the deconvoluted XRF spectra plots generated by `2_2D_XRF_deconvolution.pynb`. This includes beam intensity normalisation of pixels within an image and scatter intensity normalisation across a set of images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Raw and normalised datasets are also output as an `hdf` file that contains:\n",
    "+ **Sample/scan metadata**\n",
    "+ **2D channel plots as 3D datasets** `[x, y, channels]` under `hdf[images]`\n",
    "    + Raw in `hdf[images/raw]` and normalised in `hdf[images/normalised]`\n",
    "+ **Channel metadata** as a `pandas.Dataframe` exported by `panda.Dataframe.to_hdf` to `hdf[images/df_channel_metadata]`\n",
    "    + df row index corresponds to a channel in 3D array image stack (`[x, y, index]`), enabling column-wise storage of channel specific information (e.g. information related to experiment design such as XRF edge names, or to facilitate downstream analysis by indicating which channels should be used for segmentation). \n",
    "+ **2D masks are stored as 2D array datasets `[x, y]` under `hdf[masks]`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This repacked hdf structure is useful for storing linked image and mask data. This simplifies sharing of images with associated masks and downstream measurements of a selected image stack (raw or normalised) with the a chosen mask (e.g. cell segmentation mask). "
